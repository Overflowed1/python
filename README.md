# Python-Projects

Hello, my name is Jonas Weiß and I am from Germany. 
I created this account to show my progress with the programming language Python.

The python directory is split into several folders and the notebooks within those are named according to their content:
* <b>Big Projects:</b> contain longer projects. I usually set myself a goal (eg. Analyse a .csv) which I then work on. 
* <b>Small Notebooks (Practice):</b> contain smaller notebooks which I used to play around with Stuff. 


kind regards,

Jonas
