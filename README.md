# Python-Projects

Hello, my name is Jonas Weiß and I am from Germany. 
I created this account to show my progress with the programming language Python.

The python directory is split into several folders and the notebooks within those are named according to their content:
* <b>Big Projects:</b> contain longer projects. I usually set myself a goal (eg. to analyse a .csv-file) which I then work on. Those notebooks are structured
* <b>Small Notebooks (Practice):</b> contain smaller notebooks. They are mostly not goal-specific and unstructured. I use them to play around and learn new concepts.

<p>kind regards,<br>
Jonas
